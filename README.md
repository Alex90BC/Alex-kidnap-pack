# Alex-kidnap-pack

## Installation instructions
1) Download and install Prism Launcher. Other launchers might work as well but this is the one where the pack was tested on.
2) Download as a zip file the repository
3) Create a vanilla instance in 1.12.2 and the recommended version of Forge
4) Start the instance once and close it to make the launcher create the folder structure, in particular the .minecraft folder
5) Copy the contents of the zip file, only the files inside Alex-kidnap-pack-main folder, and paste them inside the .minecraft folder

You can now launch the instance, you have to use Java 8 to run a 1.12.2 instance, and it's recommended to give it at least 4GB of RAM to work with.
